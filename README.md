# What_If

With the recent stock market and cryptocurrency rally in the past two years I often found myself wondering how much would I have made if I bought some Solana, Dogecoin or Ethereum a while back and held it until today. Such calculations often involved a lot of back and forth price checking, multiplying, dividing and other nuisances.

To answer my questions easier I wrote a web app to check the price of a specific cryptocurrency on the selected date and return the answer of how much I would have profited (or lost) if I held until today.

The backend of the website was programmed with Python and displayed using Flask. Javascript was used to display search box suggestions while typing.

Cryptocurrency prices are taken from [Cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/).

The live version of the website can be found at https://whatif.pythonanywhere.com/
